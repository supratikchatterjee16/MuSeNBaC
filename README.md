# Musenbac
Server based Compilation tool to provide a browser based code development environment within labs.

This uses a basic server client model of operation. To use this simply:
1. Download files onto your computer
2. Compile every .java file into a class files, as I do not upload the class files
3. If you have the 'com' folder available in the directory, you are in the correct directory.
4. If not, navigate inside or outside till you have the com folder in the current listed directory
5. Open console/terminal, cd to aforementioned directory
6. java com.musenbac
7. Go to browser, and start using it
8. If you are connected to a network, determine your IP. ipconfig /all or ifconfig -a should give you the info.
9. Any computer connected to the same router, should be able to access it now, just by entering IP into the browser's address bar
10. In case there is any thing you do not understand, feel free to ask.
11. Last and the most important point. Contribute to the Open Source Community, because it rocks!!:-D

Do not make changes to any files without studying the code thoroughly.
